                    <h3 class="projectsOverviewSubheader">Coding Environment</h3>
                    <p>
                        This project is being developed in Android Studio using Java as the programming language.
                    </p>
                    <h3 class="projectsOverviewSubheader">Criteria</h3>
                    <p>
                        The 
                        <a href="res/ProjectDescription.pdf" target="_blank" class="inTextLink">criteria</a>
                        for our project was to have at least four app activities, implicit and explicit intents,
                        local data storage using both Shared Preferences and SQLite Database, sensor functionality,
                        and either camera or GPS usage.
                    </p>
                    <h3 class="projectsOverviewSubheader">Ideation</h3>
                    <p>
                        Taking this into account, my project partner and I thought of the issues that we and the general public have.
                        Since people tend to be indecisive, especially when considering places to dine out, we thought of an app that would
                        give suggestions to users about places within the vicinity. 
                    </p>
                    <h3 class="projectsOverviewSubheader">Data Acquisition</h3>
                    <p>
                        To receive data of our activities, we needed an external source of data. So we looked into some APIs that might
                        help us search for them. At first, we looked at the Eventbrite API because Eventbrite has hosted a lot of events
                        and their API might be what we were looking for, but shortly after we discovered the event search endpoint was deprecated in 2019
                        so we needed another source of data. Thankfully we found that the Yelp API does search for businesses around a given location which
                        handles our dining resources. Due to the lack of time, we decided to only let the app search for nearby restaurants and not any other
                        activities. For future developments we want to find a suitable API for the other activities.
                    </p>
                    <h3 class="projectsOverviewSubheader">Core Functionality</h3>
                    <p>
                        To implement the usage of local persistent data storage, we imported the data fetched by the Yelp API and
                        stored it directly into the SQLiteDatabase which is directly connected to a RecyclerView which gives a 
                        inflated view of listings. Each listing can be clicked to redirect into a new activity that gives the user
                        a detailed description of the activity and an implicit intent to redirect the user to a google map view of the location.
                        As for Shared Preferences, we stored the data such as search settings to filter the search. The API endpoint supported
                        parameters such as distance (in radius) and categories (such as chinese or korean cuisine) so we have those as the search settings.
                    </p>
                    <h3 class="projectsOverviewSubheader">Limitations</h3>
                    <p>
                        Initially our idea for the app was to suggest a multitude of things
                        such as restaurants, dining, events, and maybe even sports activities that users could do depending on their mood. However, down
                        the line towards the creation of our app, we were limited by several factors such as the amount of data given to us by our APIs.

                        <h3 class="projectsOverviewSubheader">API Limitations</h3>
                        <p>
                            As mentioned before, we were limited by the extent of our API data. We did not have a source of data for 
                            events, sports, and other activities. In addition to this, the category search for the businesses could not
                            help us find dessert-specific places.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Other limitations with API were things like features. We wanted to implement an image carousel with multiple
                            images of the activity (much like a product page), but we were only provided one image URL.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Since it was basically my first time working with an API, I had no idea how to do any authentication with the API key.
                            Most of the APIs I had worked with or seen before had just used an API key as a parameter in the URL.
                            Through this process, I learned how to use REST API and send a GET request to acquire my data.
                            A tool that helped me through this struggle was Postman, which helped me send requests to my APIs and visually
                            see the output of the request.
                        </p>
                        <h3 class="projectsOverviewSubheader">Time constraints</h3>
                        <p>
                            A very obvious challenge was the time constraint. We had less than a semester (roughly 2-3 months) to make the app.
                            Moving forwards after the project due date, I would like to work more on the app and fully complete and polish it to 
                            make it similar to the designs we made in the design prototype.
                        </p>
                        <h3 class="projectsOverviewSubheader">Processes and Threads</h3>
                        <p>
                            I used an AsyncTask to handle API data processing operations as well as image processing operations
                            for the Image Views, however due to their asynchronous nature, it has lead our app functionality to
                            behave disorderly, to the point where you would have to wait in the homepage or re-enter the app to have
                            the data processed.
                        </p>
                        <h3 class="projectsOverviewSubheader">Data Recycling</h3>
                        <p>
                            For multiple reasons like memory allocation and search filtering, I needed to recycle the data when
                            the user exits the page filled with listings. This will ensure that everytime users enter a different search filter,
                            they will not encounter their past results.
                        </p>
                        <h3 class="projectsOverviewSubheader">Typical Coding Issues</h3>
                        <p>
                            In addition to APIs, it was also my first time using the SQLiteDatabase and Shared Preferences.
                            This lead to a few minor memory allocation issues. There were also complications with other features such as the
                            Web View. I linked the Web View with a google maps URL to display the location of the selected listing but it never worked.

                            Making this app made me learn a lot about the tools to make an app and how to apply these tools for 
                            my personal needs as well as users in general. Even after completing the project, I still feel like the app 
                            is an unfinished product that has the potential to be something well-used by everyone.

                        <p>
                            When ideating for the project, I had no idea what kinds of apps developers could make to serve a meaningful purpose as 
                            it doesn't seem like you can do too much because of the limitations of being within a mobile device. You would have to work
                            with features and sensors that are provided by a mobile device. After seeing what other people have made and what I have made,
                            it has widened my vision for app ideas.
