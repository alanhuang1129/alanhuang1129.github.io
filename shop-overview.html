                    <p>
                        This project is all developed in HTML5 and CSS3
                    </p>
                    <h3 class="projectsOverviewSubheader">Criteria</h3>
                    <p>
                        In this project, I must design a product or service store page that
                        has company updates or events, an about section for the company, 
                        contact information, a multi-product or multi-service listing, two
                        product or service detailed view, the entire process of purchasing the product
                        or service, and a review section of the product or service.
                    </p>
                    <h3 class="projectsOverviewSubheader">Overview</h3>
                    <p>
                        Since I love to play games, I thought of doing a product page that sells game merchandise.
                        This makes the project interesting since the colour theme and style could be catered towards the 
                        specific game.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The game I have in mind is a game I was playing at the time, Genshin Impact. I thought that this was
                        going to be interesting as the aesthetics of the game can range from a rainbow-like colour theme, to a 
                        dim purple and lavender colour theme. The range of themes vastly ranged from cold to warm.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        My idea was risky. I wanted to design a page that encapsulated the elements of the game. In 
                        Genshin Impact, there are seven elements, namely Anemo, Electro, Pyro, Hydro, Cryo, Dendro, and Geo.
                        The elements correspond to air, electric, fire, water, ice, grass, and earth respectively.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        In addition to the elemental colour palette, I wanted to associate the merchandise with the appropriate 
                        element. For example, if the merchandise was for a character in the game that uses the pyro element, I would design
                        the listing around a red, firey flavour.
                    </p>
                    <h3 class="projectsOverviewSubheader">Problems</h3>
                    <p>
                        The problem I have to face is the discordance between the clashing colours. Some colour combinations 
                        might not necessarily look good. Some themes might look weird.
                    </p>
                    <h3 class="projectsOverviewSubheader">References</h3>
                    <p>
                        I have referenced websites from searching for Genshin Impact merchandise and took inspiration from the 
                        presentation of their elements. Although the colour palette is completely different, I still looked for 
                        layout presentations. One particular shop I referenced was 
                        <a class="inTextLink" href="https://www.genshin.shop/" target="_blank">
                            genshin.shop
                        </a>
                        where the homepage had a rather
                        unique layout. I also took after their detailed views which was looked like a typical detailed view but was
                        a solid one.

                            Although the colour palette was resourceful, it was also a challenge to make an unfocused wide range
                            of colours collectively blend together to make an aesthetic colour theme.

                        <p>
                            Due to my inexperience with working with html and css, designing the webpage was mainly a learning experience 
                            for me to adopt the designing skills revolving around html and css. I had to learn how to create many 
                            modules while maintaining a responsive design through relative units and media queries as well as maintaining
                            design hierarchy.

                            In conclusion, I have become more adept at using html and css and creating a responsive design for 
                            a wider range of viewers. After this project, I feel a higher understanding of the design process when 
                            working with html and css and the importance of taking into consideration of responsiveness.
