                    <h3 class="projectsOverviewSubheader">Coding Environment</h3>
                    <p>
                        This is my first project for making a game. The IDE I used to develop the game is Processing which is coded in Java.
                    </p>
                    <h3 class="projectsOverviewSubheader">Game Idea</h3>
                    <p>
                        Since I have played a lot of games in the past and I know a good amount of highly rated games.
                        The game I chose as inspiration and tried to replicate a part of it was Stardew Valley. I loved the mining
                        gameplay of Stardew Valley so I wanted to make a game around that. In addition to that, I also took inspiration from 
                        Minecraft with their pickaxe tiers and an object design from Genshin Impact.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The objective of the game is to leave the mines and to do that the player will need to navigate
                        through rooms filled with minerals.
                    </p>
                    <h3 class="projectsOverviewSubheader">Control Scheme</h3>
                    <p>
                        The player moves with 'WASD' which is default player movement. The player also has a crafting menu 
                        that also displays the inventory which is brought up by pressing 'B'. The player has a pickaxe that they 
                        can charge and swing. Players can charge their swing by holding down the Left Mouse Button (LMB). The longer
                        the player charges the pickaxe, the higher the damage the swing will be up to a certain limit. The swings are 
                        categorized into levels of swings where a heavy swing is when the player holds for approximately 2-3 seconds which will
                        deal the max damage. A heavy swing is indicated through text on the user interface.
                    </p>
                    <h3 class="projectsOverviewSubheader">Level Design</h3>
                    <p>
                        The player has to traverse through rooms where the exits to each room are at the cardinal directions of the room.
                        As the player progresses closer to the exit of the mines, they will encounter minerals that are harder to mine. 
                        For example, a Gold Ore will have triple the amount of health of an Iron Ore. This 
                        will chain of minerals will repeatedly exponentially increase every tier. The minerals in the game are: 
                        Stone, Coal, Iron, Gold, Diamond, and Obsidian, where Obsidian would have 3<sup>5</sup> times more health than Stone.
                    </p>
                    <h3 class="projectsOverviewSubheader">Gearing Up</h3>
                    <p>
                        The player starts with a stone pickaxe but can be upgraded through the minerals that the players mine.
                        To upgrade the pickaxe, players would need to craft a furnace with stone from the crafting menu and smelt iron ore and coal for iron bars.
                        Using the iron bars, the players can upgrade their pickaxe to an iron pickaxe, and upgrade their tools further through gold and diamond.
                        Each upgrade multiplies the damage the pickaxe does by three so the difficulty of breaking an iron ore from stone pickaxe would be the same as 
                        breaking a gold ore with an iron pickaxe.
                    </p>
                    <h3 class="projectsOverviewSubheader">Enemies</h3>
                    <p>
                        Some upgrades require enemy drops. I have designed one type of enemy in the game which is modelled
                        after a pillar created by Zhongli in Genshin Impact. This pillar shoots a projectile that creates pulsing areas of effect
                        (shown as yellow pulsating circles) towards the player, damaging them on contact. These enemies can be killed through pickaxe swings.

                        <p>
                            The collision handling was challenging because the player should be prevented from colliding with the rocks.
                            The only solution I could have done through code was to push the player back after they collide with the rock.
                            A few years after developing this project, I discover that games use ray tracing to detect collision ahead of the 
                            player movement to prevent the player from colliding in the obstacles.

                        <h3 class="projectsOverviewSubheader">Digital Mapping</h3>
                        <p>
                            I have never used digital mapping before to design a level so the product ended up being a little sloppy. However,
                            I still ended up working fine. Some challenges I had with it were the sizing of objects. Since not all objects were of
                            the same dimension, the mapping ended up dispropotional.

                            In the end I have learned a lot about collision and mapping of levels through code. I made a game
                            that I would be proud about, especially since it is my first game project. In retrospect, the game mechanics
                            and level design have a solid structure and narrative, enough for me to consider it a great success.
