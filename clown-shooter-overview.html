                        This game was done using Arduino for the hardware and Processing for the game visuals
                    </p>
                    <h3 class="projectsOverviewSubheader">Criteria</h3>
                    <p>
                        Since this project is about Embedded systems,
                        the project had to utilize sensor functionality, actuators, coding logic, and a game visual with Processing.
                        Some of the required sensors were light sensors, sliders, buttons, etc.
                        As for the actuators, we needed to implement motors, LEDs and a buzzer.
                    </p>
                    <h3 class="projectsOverviewSubheader">Game Idea</h3>
                    <p>
                        Taking into account of the sensors that we had and the sensors and actuators that were required to use, we eventually
                        came with the idea of setting sensors on a hand and controlling something while visually outputting the event into processing, similar
                        to an arcade game. Some ideation inspirations were those Time Crisis games in the arcade where you would have a pedal to control taking cover while
                        you shoot enemies on the screen with a physical gun. Other inspirations were carnival shootings games where you would have a rifle that shoots pellets at
                        some targets.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Our idea ended up as a game that where you shoot targets that are activated or deactivated through a motor, where
                        the weapon to shoot these targets is your hand. This would then display a game visual on Processing with a high score.
                    </p>
                    <h3 class="projectsOverviewSubheader">Sensors and Actuators</h3>
                    <p>
                        For the sensors, we used light sensors to detect when a light is shining on the target, a touch sensor to
                        shoot the gun (this will be attached to the glove), a flex sensor attached to the thumb to detect reloads.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        For the actuators, we used 3 separate motors that would bring up or down targets, LEDs to display what target was up,
                        a laser pointer that represents the gunfire (the laser will shine on the light sensors), and a buzzer to buzz when a target was shot.

                        <p>
                            We ended up encountering a lot of hardware issues where some sensors or motors don't work as intended, nor will some of the motors.
                            Some of these issues were associated with the software. As for the sensitivity, most sensors such as the flex and touch sensor may have
                            given some false positives or negatives even with pinpoint thresholds. Another issue was the wiring. Due to the excessive amount of wires,
                            some wires were loose or not even connected because the pins on the Arduino could not like with the wires.
                            Most of the other wires however were soldered and had a fine connection.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Also, due to the nature of the code, light sensors may or may not function properly in a well-lit or light-changing environment. The light sensors are coded to
                            detect a slight difference in sensor readings. Therefore, when the ambient light changes the light sensors might detect that as a target being hit.
                        </p>
                        <h3 class="projectsOverviewSubheader">Software Issues</h3>
                        <p>
                            I had encountered a lot of software issues when dealing with timing. In Arduino, there is a delay method where it would pause the code 
                            for a given amount of milliseconds. This method is desirable when working with timing, however this method halts the whole code and 
                            cannot run anything asynchronously.

                            After this project, I have learned to always test hardware functionality to ensure the problem is not
                            within the hardware. In doing so, I would be able to narrow down my bugs to only of software or firmware issues.
