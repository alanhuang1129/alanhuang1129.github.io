                        This project is being done with in communication with a real company. Everything was designed in Figma.

                    <p>
                        Working with a real company, we had to analyze and outline the company's problems using tools such as ethnography analysis,
                        personas, user journey maps, and future state journey maps. Afterwards, we would provide a solution to the problem through design.

                    <p>
                        Grandt Kitchen is a filipino restaurant that specializes in "Boodle Fights". They are one of very few filipino
                        restaurants that provide this service. The problems arises in many areas such as menus and advertising. After looking
                        into the restaurant's online prescence, we discovered the alarming need of a redesign of their website and social media. 
                        The restaurant lacks the visual appeal and awareness of Boodle Fights. Therefore, we proposed three potential design focuses.
                        a website redesign, advertisement awareness, or a menu redesign.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        We decided to redesign the menus on a physical device and on mobile, as well as a design of a table placard, and social media posts.

                        <p>
                            Communication with a business is rough because not every business is readily available to reply.
                            Some businesses don't reply until weeks later and some not at all.
                            It took a while to find a business that would cooperate with us. Even then, since it's a restaurant,
                            the owners have their busy days.

                            This project has helped me understand the process of designing solutions for problems, as well as 
                            the process of working in cooperation with a business.
